## Using


~~~
wp db ack <search> [<tables>...]

Like [ack](http://beyondgrep.com/), but for your WordPress database.
Searches through all or a selection of database tables for a given
string. Outputs colorized references to the string.

Defaults to searching through all tables registered to `$wpdb`. On
multisite, this default is limited to the tables for the current site.

**OPTIONS**

	<search>
		String to search for.

	[<tables>...]
		One or more tables to search through for the string.
